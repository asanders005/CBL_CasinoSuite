        <h1>Baccarat</h1>
        <h2>Objective of the Game</h2>
        <p>In Baccarat, the dealer draws two hands: the "Player" and the "Banker." You must place money on which hand you think will be closest to 9.</p>

        <h2>Card Values</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Aces are worth 1 point.</li>
            <li>2-9 are worth their face value.</li>
            <li>10, Jack, Queen, and King are worth 0 points.</li>
            <li>If the total exceeds 9, only the last digit of the total is used (e.g., 15 becomes 5).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Gameplay</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>The dealer deals two cards to both the Player and Banker.</li>
            <li>Depending on the value of the drawn cards, additional cards may be drawn in each hand.</li>
            <li>The winning hand is the one closest to 9.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Additional Card Rules</h2>
        <h3>Player’s Hand</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>If its total is 0-5, the Player draws a third card.</li>
            <li>If its total is 6 or 7, the Player stands.</li>
            <li>If its total is 8 or 9, it is a natural win, unless the Banker also has a natural win, in which case it is a tie.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Banker’s Hand</h3>
        <p>The Banker’s third card decision depends on the Player’s third card:</p>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Banker's Initial Total</th>
                <th>Banker Draws if Player's Third Card is</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>0-2</td>
                <td>Always draws</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>3</td>
                <td>Draws unless Player’s third card is an 8</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>4</td>
                <td>Draws if Player’s third card is 2-7</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>5</td>
                <td>Draws if Player’s third card is 4-7</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>6</td>
                <td>Draws if Player’s third card is 6 or 7</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>7</td>
                <td>Stands</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>8 or 9</td>
                <td>Natural win (no more cards drawn)</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
